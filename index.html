    <p>Hi Class! My name is John Mish, I was born in Philadelphia, I currently live in Newtown, Bucks County with my wife Madison and our bulldog Tank. I have worked in Real Estate for the past 3+ years, specifically residential sales & property management. 
    </P>
     <p>I graduated from New York University in 2009. I also played college basketball while at NYU. Upon graduating, I worked for several companies while living in New York City, most notably Foot Locker, Inc. At Foot Locker, I managed a team of replenishment analysts. Our team was responsible for inventory allocation to over 1,000 Foot Locker locations. After spending nearly ten years in NYC, I moved back home to the Philly area and began working in Real Estate.
     <p>
       In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, following the NFL (Go Birds!) & NBA (Go Sixers!), as well as traveling. In recent years, I have visted Hong Kong (pictured), Thailand, Italy, Iceland as well as various US Cities, including New Orleans, Denver, Nashville, Chicago and more!  
     </p>
     <p>
            I'm excited to learn more about coding through this class. For the time being, I'm hoping to improve my Real Estate marketing and then eventually pursue a career in tech within the sports industry!
